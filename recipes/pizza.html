        In a small bowl, <b>ombine the active dry yeast with the warm water and sugar</b>. Stir gently and let stand for
        <b>5-10 minutes</b> until the mixture becomes foamy. Then in a large bowl, <b>mix 2 and Â½ cups wheat flour and 2 teaspoons salt</b>.
        Make a well in the center of the flour. Pour the active yeast mixture into the hollow in the flour. 
        Also add <b>2 tablespoons of olive oil</b>. Begin mixing the ingredients with a wooden spoon until the dough begins to form.

        Transfer the dough to a lightly floured surface and knead for about <b>5-7 minutes</b>, or until the dough is smooth and elastic.
        <b><em>If the dough is too sticky, add a little more flour</em></b>. Form the dough into a ball and place it in a lightly greased bowl. 
        Cover the bowl with a damp cloth and <b>let the dough rest in a warm place for about 1 hour</b>, or until it has doubled in size.
